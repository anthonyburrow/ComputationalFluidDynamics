# ComputationalFluidDynamics

Python module of basic CFD scripts that generate animations/plots.

## Plotting

Currently plotting and initial conditions are set up for Navier-Stokes cavity
flow test. These settings and functions (in `plot.py` and
`InitialCondition.py`) must be changed for plots of other tests to look
appropriate.
